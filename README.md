# How to install manually

Download the latest release from the Releases section and place the files in the matching folders on your Pocket's SD card, it's that simple! :)

# Neptune isn't a NeoGeo!

I know but as far as I know there isn't a proper NeoGeo representation in the Hyperdimension universe aside from NepGeo who was never properly visualized. And besides that it felt wrong to not have Neptune somewhere in the pack :P

# Will you add more platforms?

It's unlikely because it was hard enough to find good artworks of the matching representations as it is but if you have any suggestions let me know via an Issue and I'll see what I can do :)
